In this report we discuss the tuning of a simple Deep Neural Network model for the classification of 2D data patterns. Through several steps, we select a model capable of achieving good performances (classification error) whilst reducing its overall complexity. Eventually, we test such model on increasingly more elaborated data patterns to prove that its effectiveness holds. We also show that the theoretical bound on the expressive power of a neural network, about the minimum number of layers and neurons, is an helpful suggestion in order to reduce the number of epochs necessary to achieve an optimal target accuracy.
